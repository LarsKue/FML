# How to use create_handin.py

First, edit the file and exchange our Team names with your Team names (lines 19-21).

Ensure your current working directory is one level **up** from the exercise directory.
Then, simply run the script with `python create_handin.py <exercise name> <notebook name>`.

The exercise directory must be named the same as what you want the hand-in to have at
the end (e.g. "ex01a" for the first exercise).
You can compare your file structure to the one of this repository.

You can add more files to the hand-in by specifying a glob pattern in the `--more` option.

You can view more information about the tool using `python create_handin.py -h`.

The script assumes you have both a python 3 interpreter as well as jupyter added to your environment variables.
It was tested on Windows 10, using Python 3.8.

### Disclaimer: I do not take responsibility for your hand-in points if you use this tool, even if you use it correctly. Always double check your hand-in zip files.
